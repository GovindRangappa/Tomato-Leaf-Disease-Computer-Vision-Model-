# Tomato Leaf Disease Detection & Classification

This project detects tomato leaves in an image using YOLOv8 and classifies each detected leaf as **Bacterial Spot**, **Early Blight**, or **Healthy** using a ResNet18 classifier.

The model weights are hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/GovRang/tomato-leaf-model) and are automatically downloaded when you run the script â€” no manual downloading required.
